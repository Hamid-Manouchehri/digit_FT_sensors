## Notes:
1. Since data is not being tracked by the repo, wherever you clone the repository, create a `/data` directory including folders of `csv_FT_data`, `csv_fabric_sensor`, `img_data` and `xdf_files`.

2. Activate the conda environment while using python scripts: `conda activate CONDA_ENV_NAME`.
